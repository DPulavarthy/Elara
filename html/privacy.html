            <p>1) Guilds</p>
            <i>
                The guild name and ID is used to create a Database entry for your server, so you can use different
                features within the bot, such as warnings, kicks, bans, softbans and logging.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>2) Channels</p>
            <i>
                The channel IDs collected are used to set/configure the channels to do certain actions such as: logging,
                suggestions, welcome and leave channels, ignoring channels for logging purposes.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>3) Users</p>
            <i>
                The username and ID is used to create a Database entry for yourself for the currency, profile, afk and
                custom commands and for the server's warnings.
            </i>
            <i>
                If you wish to delete your profile for currency use: <code>reset me</code> in the server that you want
                it to be removed from.
            </i>
            <i>
                If you wish to delete your profile you'll have to join the
                <a href="https://discord.gg/qafHJ63" external>support server</a>
                and request your data to be removed.
            </i>
            <i>
                If you wish to delete your server's warnings you will have to contact that server's staff to remove
                them.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>4) Roles</p>
            <i>
                The role ID is used for the welcome/autojoin role, this is given once a user joins a server.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>5) User's Guilds</p>
            <i>
                The user's guilds is referring to the guilds that are returned when you authorized the services to
                access to them, This is used to make sure you're in the support server before accessing the website.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>6) Paste/Haste Content.</p>
            <i>
                The paste/haste content is stored in the database for 2-3 weeks until being deleted unless it's set as
                <code>never delete</code> in that case the paste/haste content will be stored indefinitely.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p sec7>7) Message Data</p>
            <i>
                <b yellow>NOTE: </b> ALL message content, attachments is encrypted.
                <i>content</i>

            </i>
            <i>
                The message is stored in the database for 1-2 days, if not deleted sooner.
            </i>
            <i>
                Message data is used for the bot's message logging system for server owners or admins to use at their
                discretion.
            </i>
            <br />

            <p>8) Announcement/Say Security Logging</p>
            <i>
                When you use the <code>announce</code> or <code>say</code> commands, the server, channel, user and
                message content(content is encrypted, to avoid any security concerns) gets logged to a channel only the
                developer(s) have access to.
            </i>
            <i>
                Due to events that's happened before with people abusing bots that have those commands, making the bot
                say something in a server then reporting it to Discord, I've opted to log that information and have the
                (ID: 123456789) userID of the person that used the command at the bottom of the embed for security
                purposes and to protect the bot for future use and so the bot doesn't get banned if someone does do
                that, I would have the logs of it and can prove it wasn't the bot posting that type of stuff.
            </i>
            <p><code>TLDR; It's for security purposes, to protect the bot from bad actors.</code></p>
            <br />

            <p>How to remove your data from our services</p>
